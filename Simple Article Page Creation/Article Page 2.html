	<sup>2</sup>Normally when writing a <b><q>public communication</q></b> piece you want to be looking at examples to get a feel for their tone. 
	However, with newspapers there is also a need to think about the range of reliability that they represent.When thinking about the press, we could look at it as a spectrum on the basis of reliability due to the variety of articles and news outlets. 
	<i>The reliability spectrum.</i> <mark>Starting with the most reliable type of articles on the left and moving right towards the most unreliable.</mark> First there is "impartial and objective reporting of facts", moving to "complex analysis" then "opinion pieces and persuasive articles." 
	Then the spectrum goes into more unreliable articles which are selective and don't tell the full story, they may also be used for propaganda. On the far right of the spectrum there is "fake news" which is fabricated and uses unreliable sources.

	<p>If you are writing to inform, aim for your work to be on the objective end of the spectrum where you stay impartial, leaving personal opinions out of your work. Whereas, if you are writing to persuade or analyse consider moving down the spectrum. Here we find the likes of Letters to the Editor and Opinion Pieces; work that is critical and has more focus on the writer's opinions. 
	When writing any form of article ensure that you are not creating fake news (false or misleading information presented as news). Use reliable sources and cite all references to keep your work credible, think of this as any other assessment. You will lose marks for not using and citing references correctly. Use our Referencing Guide to ensure you use the correct referencing system.
	The reliability spectrum can be highly influenced by politics and the political view points of journalists, editors and sometimes owners of publications which will determine the tone of their articles. Your assessment brief will determine where your work sits on the spectrum, depending on whether you've been asked to inform, educate or persuade.
