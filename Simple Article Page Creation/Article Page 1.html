		<b><i>Introduction to Newspaper Articles</i></b>
	</h2>

	<p>
	<sup>1</sup>There are many types of newspapers, from school/university publications to large news outlets like the Daily Mail, or Guardian. Local papers will focus more on events in and around the community, for example they may cover community fates or markets. They’ll also have stories about local people. They will still be written in a <strong>professional</strong> and <em>formal</em> way but may have a more conversational tone. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<mark>Unlike local papers, national publications will focus more on events that effect the wider populous.</mark>  They will also report on noteworthy international events, such as crises and wars, but also sporting and entertainment events like the Olympics. They advertise to a much wider audience than local papers and need to relate to most of the population.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<b><i>Purpose of a Newspaper Article</i></b>
	</h2>
	<p>
	News articles are written to inform and educate readers on current affairs/events. They are used to provide readers with information they need/want to know about the world around them. You will either be told what to write your article on or have a choice of topics related to the module this assessment is for.
	Newspaper articles give as much information as possible at the time of publication; if a journalist writes about an ongoing case there may be limited information available, so they might interview people related to the case, or try find background information to help inform readers more.
	</p>
	<p>
	<q>News articles are written on a whole range of topics</q> due to the large target audiences of newspapers.<mark> Most papers will have several sections ranging from current national and international affairs to sports and celebrity news.</mark> There are some papers, however which solely focus on a specific topic, therefore have a smaller target audience.
